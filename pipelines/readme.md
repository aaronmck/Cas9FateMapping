#### Pipelines ####

The pipelines here depend on the [GATK Queue](https://www.broadinstitute.org/gatk/guide/topic?name=queue) engine.  I haven't checked in 
the jar file for Queue, as it's best to build it yourself with the most up-to-date version.  The version we used to produce the data in 
the paper is CRISPR_analysis_PE_V2.scala.
